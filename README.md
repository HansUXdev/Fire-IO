# Fire-IO
AngularJS / Firebase CMS that can be hosted in a static environment [demo](http://stackoverload.me/demos/fire-io/index.html)

*NOTE:
There currently is no admin panel for content, I'm working on the client-side of things currently and I manually add / edit data in the firebase panel. If you'd like to contribute I can give you access.*
