Fire IO is a themeable real-time CMS that can be hosted in a static enviornment (such as GitHub pages). This means you can edit your website all within your GitHub page url (without pushing or manually editing files) for free (Unless you go over the free plan for Firebase). This is the current [milestone](https://github.com/Stackoverload/Fire-IO/milestones/v0.1%20release)


*NOTE:
There currently is no admin panel for content, I'm working on the client-side of things currently and I manually add / edit data in the firebase panel. If you'd like to contribute I can give you access.*
